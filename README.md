# bikesharing Module 14
## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to explore and apply Tableu, , that is very popular and robust data análisis and visualization tool. The main idea is that a couple of people want to start a bike-share bussiness on their hometown, Des Moines, based on their experience in their last vacation in New York where  this service is highly used.

First, they want to figure out how this business works in New York in order to create a proposal on how it could work in Des Moines.  Data, contained in a flat file, a CSV, from the Citi Bike program in New York City will be used in this project

By using this file with Tableu, a gropu of visualizations will be created in order to understand how the demand and tendency of this business work in that city. Some work sheets will be built as well as some dashboards

Finally a story will be created. It must include information about number of bike trips,  the length of time that bikes are checked out for all type of of user and genders as weel as number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
 
## Results

In order to reach the goal of this project about 17 worksheets were built as well as three dashboard and the final story.

This book is posted on this this Tableu  public web page:

This chart shows that subscribers use the service the most.  They are around 73%  of the service users.

•	Trips by gender  chart is showed below

Male customers are around 65% of the customer while women are only 25%

It is clear that 8 to 9 a.m and 5 to 6 p.m are the hours where the service is demanded the most. However it is possible to affirm that this service has a high demand almost all hours of the day but 1 to 4 a.m.


•	Trip duration by user age chart  is showed below

As it is described in the Plateu Story,  Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are the days when male subscribers demand the service the most. Female subscribers demand has the same tendency all days of the week but Wednesday.

Saturday and Sunday show the highest demand for female customers while Wednesday shows the lowest one



## Summary

As a summary, it is possible to affirm that a bike-share business is feasible   on a city like Des Moines. However particular conditions must be considered in order to be successful.

•	New York is considered a city that never sleep and that condition makes the service demanded almost all the day. In Des Moines this service could have a different tendency depending of its own conditions.

•	To encourage people to be subscribers could be a good strategy because they demand the service the most. Enrolled a significant amount of people as subscribers will help the business to be successful.

•	Encourage women to enroll and to use the service could increase the number of users.

•	Wednesday seems to be a day where demand is low, so it could be a good day for lower fees and other commercial offerings.
